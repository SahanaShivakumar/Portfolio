            Small Tidbits:
        </h3>
        <p>
            I live in a small town called Kennett Square in Pennsylvania. 
            <span>
                I live with my mom, dad, and grandpa.
            </span> 
            <span>
                I also have an older sister in university. 
            </span>

                I've been learning piano for the past 10 years and violin for the seven most recent years within.
            </span>
            <span>
                I also started leaning an Indian Classical Dance called Bharathanatyam in first grade and still thoroughly enjoy performing.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span>
                I am absolutely terrified of any type of spider, including the really small ones. 
            </span>
            <span>
                But I'm not afraid of insects as much, except all bees and wasps.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span>
                I'm also allergic to most nuts, with the exception of almonds, pecans, walnuts, and pine nuts.
            </span>
            <span>
                My entire family is vegetarian, so I've never purposely eaten any sort of meat. 
            </span>
            <span>
                My favorite food would probably be rasam sadam with potato curry on the side.
            </span>

            I really love any sort of South Indian cuisine, but I'll also eat Thai, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican food.
            <span>
                I also enjoy reading fiction books. It's a great passtime.
